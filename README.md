# Movie Recommendation System and App

This project entails the development of a movie recommendation system integrated with a mobile app. The system suggests movies similar to the user's preferences and provides detailed information about each movie. It leverages the IMDb API for movie details and implements various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and analyze movie descriptions and metadata.

## Introduction
The movie recommendation system provides users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences. It employs machine learning models to analyze movie metadata and user preferences, enabling accurate recommendations. The system also features integration with a mobile app, allowing users to explore recommended movies and search for specific titles.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- IMDb API
- Flask (for backend)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- CountVectorizer (from scikit-learn)
- Cosine Similarity
- Mobile App Development (Flutter)

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:
- **Backend Server**: Developed using Flask, the backend server handles API requests from the mobile app and interacts with the recommendation system.
- **Recommendation System**: Utilizes NLP techniques and machine learning models to generate movie recommendations.
- **IMDb API Integration**: Fetches detailed information about movies from the IMDb API.
- **Mobile App**: Developed using Flutter, the mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for accessing movie recommendations.

## Recommendation System
The recommendation system employs NLP techniques and machine learning models to generate movie recommendations. It preprocesses movie descriptions and metadata using techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization. Cosine similarity is then used to measure the similarity between movies, and the system recommends movies with the highest similarity scores to the user.

## Integration with Mobile App
The mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for accessing movie recommendations and exploring movie details. It communicates with the backend server via RESTful APIs to fetch recommended movies and display their information. Users can also search for specific movies within the app and receive recommendations based on their search queries.

## NLP Techniques
The project utilizes various NLP techniques to process and analyze movie descriptions and metadata:
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down movie descriptions into individual words or tokens.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root forms to improve processing efficiency.
- **Vectorization**: Converting text data into numerical vectors for machine learning model input.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measuring the similarity between movies based on their feature vectors.

## Usage
To use the movie recommendation system and app:
1. Start the backend server using Flask.
2. Access the mobile app and interact with the user interface to receive movie recommendations and explore movie details.
